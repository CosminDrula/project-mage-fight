        This is a project made for the Algorithm Design Course at [FACE](https://ace.ucv.ro/)
            
Mage Fighter is a fast-paced, magical score-attack game where you have 4 minutes to defeat as many enemies as possible and earn the highest score.

Once you load up the game, you'll start in the main menu; Here is what you can do: 

1. FUNCTIONALITY OF MY GAME:
Pressing the " Play " Button starts a Challenge run.

The Challenge
Face off against 5 Waves of AI-controlled enemies including:

    🧙‍♂️ 3 Evil Mages that drain your score if left alive
    
    🐦 Chaos Birds that swarm the skies
    
    🎩 Cursed Magic Hats, how many birds had the vile mages filled them with??
    
Your goal: defeat as many enemies as you can before time runs out.

🔄 Elemental Matchups

Some enemies have elemental protection — they can only be defeated using the correct type of spell:

    🔥 Fire

    ❄️ Ice
    
    ⚡ Electricity
    
Press " Z " to enter symbol-drawing mode and switch your current element. Matching the enemy’s weakness is essential to winning.

🧠 Arcane Mage State

switching elements activates the Arcane Mage state:

    You begin chanting, enhancing your power.
    
    Your mana is rapidly converted into score when you are chanting
    
    If your mana hits zero, you exit Arcane Mage state.
    
This high-risk, high-reward mode rewards aggressive play — but manage your mana wisely.

🧨 Strategic Threats

    When Monster Mages are active on the field, your score rapidly decays over time.
    
    Take them out quickly to stop the loss and restore control.

🕹️ Controls

    Mouse: Aim your spells
    
    Left Click: Cast spell
    
    Z: Enter symbol-drawing mode to switch element
    
    X: Exit symbol-drawing mode
    
    T: End the Challenge early and return to the main menu 

📈 Scoring

    Defeat enemies to increase your score

    The tougher the enemy, the more points you gain
    
    Monster Mages cause score drain while alive
    
    Maximize your efficiency before the timer runs out!
    
2. OTHER MAIN MENU BUTTONS, Press " Esc " to go back from any of these menus

      Here you will get to learn the Symbols necessary to change your elemental afinity.

3. SHORTCOMINGS/DISFUNCTIONAL TRAITS OF MY PROJECT:

       Unoptimized Update() function calls, the game visibly slows down if the number of moving enemies is > 20.
   
       Lack of enemy variety and mediocre visual effects.
   
       The "Arcane Mage state" had more gameplay significance that is now cut from the final game due to project complexity.
